# tabris-helloworld-copied

Minimal version of tabris.js app which successfully compiles for Android

Tested with:

- Tabris 3.8.0+
- Samsung S7 with Android 9

To create your own app and compile it online, **without installing anything on your PC**: 

- Fork this repository
- Rename as you like
- Go to https://build.tabris.com/ and click on "My Apps"

- Click con "Create app" button
- Search your repository and select it

Tabris will try validating the app; it should work as it worked for me...

Once app is validated, you can compile it:

- select the app
- click on "Build Android app" (no need to change settings now)
- you will see a flashing "RUNNING" text; it will take several minutes to compile; you can follow the progress by clicking on the elapsed time
- if compilation is successful, a download button (down-arrow button) will appear, allowing you to download tha .apk file: copy/send it to your phone and install it
- if compilation fails, you will see "RUNNING" turning into "FAILED"; check the log to figure out what went wrong.
